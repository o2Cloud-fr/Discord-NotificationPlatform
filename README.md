The Discord Notification Platform is a web application that allows users to create and send customized messages on Discord. The application provides a user-friendly interface where users can fill out a form with various fields to create a customized Discord message. Once the form is submitted, the data is sent to a Node.js server which processes the information and sends it via a Discord webhook.
